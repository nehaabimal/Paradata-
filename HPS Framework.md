## Genre and Goal

My Twine story "“Living Objects Trapped in Glass Boxes”: the Importance of Rematriating Indigenous Cultural Objects and Indigenizing Museums" is a playthrough of how young journalist Nehaa Bimal's pursuit of a feature story on repatriation and the decolonization of museums led to the discovery of the story of the stolen Shebahonaning Anishinaabe cultural artefacts and remains by the University of Michigan's Anthropological Museum. It features a lot of first person perpectives and narrative elements inspired by my namesake article, and has a historical background - the archeological excavations at Killarney Bay, Ontario conducted by Dr Emerson F. Greenman in the 1950s. 

## Gameworld
The Twine begins by introducing the relevancy of repatriation of Indigenous First Nation artefacts (cultural objects) and the human remains of their ancestors and how the museums that archive or hold them are a part of the “colonial project." The Twine story takes the player to Killarney Centennial Museum and then to the digital archives of UMichigan's Department of Archeological and Anthropological Museum. I also provide background on Dr. Greenman's excavations of burial sites in Killarney. 

## Player Agent, Choices and Actions 

- The player agent embodies my experience as an investigative journalist uncovering an untold history by asking the right questions and being curious (and respectful towards the Indigenous communities being covered). I give the player choices within my Twine in regards to the interview questions and conducting further research (such as historical background on Dr. Greenman's excavations of burial sites in Killarney + thoughts from experts on repatriation by museums), as well as the angles pursued which will impact the story being told. 
- Choices in my Twine include asking Hannah Zamiska, the primary agent and curator of the Killarney Centennial Museum either of the two questions: 

**''What does it mean to have these cultural objects taken away from your local community? ''**  or  "So, what happened to the Shebahonaning Anishinabek cultural objects and where are they now?"** 

One leads to further investigation and the other will lead to a quote that shows how the loss of the artefacts is severing the tie between Indigenous peoples and their past, contributing to the erasure of contemporary Indigenous people. 

The second choice allows the player to decide whether to conduct further research on Dr Greenman or directly jump into looking at images of the stolen artefacts in the archives. In order to have a holistic/complete understanding of the story, players should ideally conduct research first. 

The final choice is on the type of angle to pursue for this story. 

You can choose to either ask the primary agent Sarah Proulx more about the shutdown in communications from the University of Michigan, which is an interesting angle to show how unethical archeological pratices in the past are also translating to the present.  
This shows the “the colonial legacy of anthropology and archaeology.”  Or the player can decide to focus on rematriation and Indigenizing museums by interviewing other museum curators and directors." 

When I was writing my feature article, I realized that I could have split the article into two different stories, so I would like to give my player the option to explore either subject that fascinates them further. 

- ## Agents
The agents within my Twine are narrative plot advancers as they are my interviewees. The quotes that are highlighted in red and italicized are actual quotes from my sources that I collected and featured in my story. 


# Goal

These quotes are included to allow the viewer to realize the emotional impact the historical loss of these cultural objects had on the Anishinaabe community in Killarney, the full force of unethical practices conducted by UMichigan, as well as insight into repatriation/rematriation. The interactions the player has with my sources/the agents will impact the depth and accuracy of the story being told, which is what I hope the Twine does. I want the player agent to realize that you do not have to be a historian to be involved in historical research, as I myself was educated as a journalist on the impact and complexities of repatriation on Indigenous communities. I want them to see some of the elements that goes into investigative reporting and the sheer number of sources that are required to be thorough and accurate.

## Resources, Tools, Obstacles 

There are many resources included in the Twine, such as SoundCloud links on how to correctly pronounce **Shebahonaning**, the Indigenous name for Killarney, Ontario, as well as links to the actual interview with Sarah Proulx, an agent/source who is an Indigenous anthropologist from uToronto. 

I also have screenshots of the Indigenous artefacts being displayed in the UMichigan archives. 

In an ideal world, I would have been able to link my Mural website "Open AI's DALL-E Homogenizes, Stereotypes, and Culturally Appropriates Indigenous Artefacts." I offer viewers an alternative research option since I had used Open AI's DALL-E to generate graphic art to better illustrate my feature article in my Unessay. 

My sources/agents are tools as they provide a lot of insight into the topic of repatriation like the quotes from Dr. Allan J. Ryan, an associate professor in the School of Indigenous and Canadian ay Studies at Carleton University and John Moses, the Director of Repatriation and Indigenous Relations at the Canadian War Museum.
